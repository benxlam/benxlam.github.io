        <b>S</b>canning <b>E</b>lectron <b>M</b>icroscopy paired with <b>E</b>nergy <b>D</b>ispersive <b>S</b>pectroscopy (SEM/EDS) 
        images enable high magnification analysis of a sampleâ€™s morphology and chemical composition.  
        The analysis of SEM/EDS images often involves comparing multiple scans at the same time.  
        In my case, I wanted to compare the results of 5 different samples over 5 time steps, with each 
        time step having upwards of 10 scans each (<b>>250 scans</b>!).  I chose to organize this data into an 
        <b>automatically generated PowerPoint presentation</b> since each image set (SEM image + elemental maps) 
        can be grouped into a slide, and each imaging session grouped into a PowerPoint presentation.  
        The data is also usually directly presented in PowerPoints, so this conversion also saves time 
        making slides.
