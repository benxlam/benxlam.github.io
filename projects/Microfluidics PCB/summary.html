        I developed an Arduino Mega shield with the ability to control up to <b>32 solenoids</b> 
        and record from 4 pressure sensors for microfluidics testing.  The board takes 24V 
        input and includes a <b>buck converter</b> to step down the power to 12V for the Arduino.  
        A CANBUS module is also installed as an option for external communication.
