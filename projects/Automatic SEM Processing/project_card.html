        <b>S</b>canning <b>E</b>lectron <b>M</b>icroscopy paired with <b>E</b>nergy <b>D</b>ispersive <b>S</b>pectroscopy (SEM/EDS) 
        images enable high magnification analysis of a sampleâ€™s morphology and chemical composition.  
        The analysis of SEM/EDS images often involves comparing multiple scans at the same time.  
        In my case, I wanted to compare the results of 5 different samples over 5 time steps, with each 
        time step having upwards of 10 scans each (<b>>250 scans</b>!).  I developed a set of tools to 
        a) organize the data into an <b>automatically generated PowerPoint presentation</b> and 
        b) crop SEM/EDS scans to the same scale for publication and presentations.
